    "We usually don't see it when we open a notebook in Jupyter but if we try to read them as text files (say for instance by checking the raw version of a notebook on Github) or try to use `git` on them we are almost lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is problematic for doing version control, first because we are unable to check effectively what is happening from commit to commit, but also because we don't need `git` to monitor *everything* inside our notebooks: if we change mundane details, in plots for instance, we would like to know the parameter we've changed but not which pixel on our screen is different from the previous version. \n",
